# Automatic Speech Recognition

Welcome to the **Automatic_Speech_Recognition** repository! This project focuses on leveraging advanced models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) using state-of-the-art techniques in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). The goal is to transcribe speech audio into text accurately and efficiently across multiple languages.

## Project Overview

**Automatic_Speech_Recognition** utilizes the Whisper-large-v3 model from OpenAI, which is designed for ASR tasks. The project offers a comprehensive solution for transcribing speech across various languages with high accuracy and performance.

### Model Setup

The project employs the Whisper-large-v3 model for ASR tasks. Key setup steps include:

- Utilization of GPU support for enhanced processing speed.
- Loading the pretrained model with optimized CPU memory usage.
- Integration of the AutoProcessor for tokenization and feature extraction.
- Configuration of parameters such as batch size, chunk length, and maximum new tokens.
